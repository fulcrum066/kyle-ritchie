<h1>Anomaly Detection:</h1>
<body>
Description: In this project, I am attempting to create a program which can detect anomalies in sets of data collected from my home network. Many modern network security systems collect data on the behaviour of their users within the system, as well as the types of packets being sent throughout it. What I am attempting to do is create a custom packet sniffer to collect data on the types of packets which enter my home network, and as well as create an algorithm which can analyse this data and detect anomalies within it.

Currently I have almost finished creating this packet sniffer, and have also found a YouTube tutorial which I can use to create the analysis algorithm. 

In the future, I would like to learn how to use the pytorch library within Python in order to create an AI to replace the analysis algorithm.
